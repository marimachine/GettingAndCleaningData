This is the course project for the courser course '84Getting and Cleaning data

The R script '84run_analysis.R'93 is performing several data cleaning steps that can be summarized as follows:


1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one datasets
2. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The final dataset is called tidy.txt and will be stored with the row_names = FALSE option.

ANd this is not a test.

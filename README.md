\
This is the course project for the courser course \'84Getting and Cleaning data\'93\
The R script \'84run_analysis.R\'93 is performing several data cleaning steps that can be summarized as follows:\
\
# 1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one datasets\
# 2. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set\
# 3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.\
# 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.\
# 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.\
\
The final dataset is called tidy.txt and will be stored with the row_names = FALSE option.}
